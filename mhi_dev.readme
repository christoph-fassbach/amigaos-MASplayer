MHI is a new standard for MPEG audio on the Amiga. It was created by Thomas
Wenzel and Paul Qureshi, with help from Dirk Conrad, because current systems
(mpega.library and the mpeg.device) do not offer the features modern
applications such as AmigaAMP require.

This archive contains everything you need to develop programs using MHI and
MHI drivers for new hardware or software decoders. Please support MHI, we
really think it's the best possible solution for playing MPEG audio on
AmigaOS!

Thanks to Doobrey for the Blitz II include file!

What's new in v1.2?
-------------------
 - Added new queries and parameters to make it easy to go beyond MPEG audio.
 - Added new queries and parameters to support 5-band and 10-band equalizers.
 - Fixed MASPlayerDriver so that it doesn't trash register A6 any more.
 - Recompiled MASPlayerDriver with amiga-gcc.
